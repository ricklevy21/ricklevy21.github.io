    <h1>The Humble Grasshopper</h1>
    <p>The grasshopper, which is a family of insects with thousands of species, is my favorite animal. The simple, yet highly effective trait, of legs that allow for hopping, has made them very successfull across the globe. Below is an image of a grasshopper from the <i>Melanoplus dodgei</i> species group that live in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.</p>
